It has clearly split the world into the dark forces and the forces of light. \n\nThat might sound like an oversimplification, but I assure you, it is not. \n\nAfter what Hamas did, if you stand anywhere besides right next to Israel, you are part of the forces of darkness. \n\nPeriod. \n\nIt might not be politically correct to say, but if you side with Hamas, if you are glorifying Bin Laden, if you are chanting for the genocide of the Jewish people, if you are calling for Israel to cease its fire and let Hamas continue to exist, there really is no other way to say this and I‚Äôm sorry I have to be the one to tell you this, but you chose wrong. You chose evil. You are an accomplice to it all! \n\nIt‚Äôs not too late to reconsider but if you don‚Äôt, and you stand against Israel now, you will be held accountable. \n\nHamas has helped clear things up and now the world knows clearly who is good and who is evil. \n\nAnd thanks to the internet, there will be no denying where you stood. We see you and we won‚Äôt forget. \n\nStand with justice. \n\nStand with morality. \n\nStand with humanity. \n\nStand with Israel!"

She tells Islamists that their violence is never justified, no matter how much they use their victim card as an excuse (link attached below).\nHer statements during this TV interview, explain a lot about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. She slams all the Islamists who justify violence against Jews and Christians by using their victim status as a justification for their actions: ◊¥The Jews have come from the tragedy (of the Holocaust), and forced the world to respect them, with their knowledge, not with their terror, with their work, not their crying and yelling. Humanity owes most of the discoveries and science of the 19th and 20th centuries to Jewish scientists. 15 million people, scattered throughout the world, united and won their rights through work and knowledge. We have not seen a single Jew blow himself up in a German restaurant. We have not seen a single Jew destroy a church. We have not seen a single Jew protest by killing people. But the Muslims...◊¥\n\nLink to the video: https://t.co/BGZ1Np4Co6"

    "text": "The entire framing of the conflict is so consistently dishonest and meant to drive certain narratives. \n\nThe way much of the press downplay Oct 7th as just some data point in the conflict, instead of the worst terror attack in recent history. The way they pretend the ongoing conflict is one sided, ignoring the the thousands of rockets shot at Israeli cities constantly, hundreds of thousands of Israeli families that have left their homes and spend days in bomb sheltered, families still burying loved ones, hostages being kept by Hamas, young people now risking their lives to take on Hamas etc\n\nAnd even just with Gaza: They take the Hamas death toll as fact (a mistake), but then also frame all the deaths as Israeli responsibility. No differentiation between Hamas terrorists killed Vs civilians. No differentiation between the countless civilians killed by Hamas/IJ (20-30% of rockets fall in Gaza) vs in Israeli strikes. No acknowledgement of Hamas‚Äô responsibility in hiding among civilians (a war crime) and trying to prevent them from leaving the war zone. \n\nEvery single aspect of the framing is one-sided and then they use that framing to apply pressure on Israel to give Hamas an out."
