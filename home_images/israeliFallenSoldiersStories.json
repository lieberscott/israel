Here's what he said in October on Facebook (shortened):\n\n\"Shalom, my name is Ahmad Au Latif, father to little Mansura, 11 months old. \n\nI am proud to be a Bedouin-Israeli!\n\nFor me, the people I live and work with are my brothers and sisters, and we all live together and respect each other in our land. I am proud to be a Bedouin that served in the IDF as a combat soldier. I was blessed to have a meaningful service that I will never forget. During my service I discovered my strength and capabilities, and how I can deal with challenges, and I met amazing people who are friends for life.\n\nI'm happy to be able to connect betweeen cultures. I can invite my friends to have meat and Maqluba in Rahat, and I can come to the garden in the Kibbutz where they play guitar and sing Hebrew songs. I am happiest when I can travel the country with my friends and when I teach them Arabic and they try to speak with me and ask for help.\n\nDuring the war we have fallen soldiers who are Bedouin, Druze, Muslims abd Christians - they died heroes protecting our country.\n\nI want to awaken everybody reading this: we all share the same fate and we must be united. Unfortunately there are people who don't believe we should be and are trying to scare and break the trust - do not let them.\""

He writes:\n\nIf you are reading these words, something must have happened to me. If I was kidnapped, I demand that no deal be made for the release of any terrorist to release me. Our overwhelming victory is more important than anything, so please continue to work with all your might so that the victory is as overwhelming as possible.\n\nMaybe I fell in battle. When a soldier falls in battle it is sad, but I ask you to be happy. Don't be sad when you part with me. Touch hearts, hold each other's hands and strengthen each other. We have so much to be proud and happy about.\n\nWe are writing the most significant moments in the history of our nation and the entire world. So please, be happy, be optimistic, keep choosing life all the time. Spread love, light and optimism. Look at your loved ones in the whites of their eyes and remind them that everything we go through in this life is worth it and we have something to live for. \n\nDon't stop the power of life for a moment I was already wounded in operation Tzuk Eitan, but I do not regret that I returned to fight. This is the best decision I ever made."

If Israel was committing anything even remotely resembling genocide, there would be zero Israeli casualties. \n\nStop believing lies and start using your brain.  \n\nOh, and by the way, several of the casualties from yesterday are Israeli Arabs.
