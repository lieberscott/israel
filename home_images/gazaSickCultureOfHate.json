As you can see in this video (link below) senior Hamas leader Fathi Hammad demonstrates how Jews will be treated in \"Free Palestine\".\n\nIn 2005 Gaza was \"free\" after Israel expelled all the Jews and gave the territories to the Palestinian Authority. Sadly, in 2006 the Palestinians in Gaza voted Hamas into power, even though its charter explicitly calls for the genocide of Jews. Israel was forced to defend itself after Hamas began terrorizing Israeli civilians in the south. We didn't build a wall and security fences \"just for fun\". \n\nThis video and the terrorist attack on October 7th make the intentions of Hamas very clear. Hamas terrorists don't want a state alongside the State of Israel. They want a state instead of the State of Israel.\nHamas terrorists do not want \"coexistence\" with the Jews as they publicly and explicitly call for genocide and ethnic cleansing of Jews.\n\nLink to the video: https://t.co/bLM4ekVJ3E\n\nPlease retweet if you support Israel's right to exist and defend itself!"

Another 5 \"journalists\" were killed while being close to other terrorists who were eliminated.\n\nFor example, the \"journalist\" Maztapa Taria who was killed alongside the \"journalist\" Hamza al-Dahdo, who according to documents found by the IDF in Gaza, both belonged to the terrorist organizations in Gaza. \n\nor the journalists Muhammad Mater, Anas Abu Shamla and Montaser al-Sawaf - all belong to the terrorist organization Hamas. All these are just examples of \"journalists\" killed in Gaza.\n\nOnly 19% of the killed journalists were not proven to be terrorists, and the circumstances of their deaths were not precisely determined. In any war, circumstances may become clear in the future, and sometimes journalists die in tragic circumstances\n\nWhile in  Israel has press freedom and liberal democracy, allowing any journalist visiting Israel to speak freely, And every journalist who has been in Israel will testify to that. in Gaza, controlled by the fundamentalist Islamic terror organization Hamas, has no press freedom at all.\n\nEvery war is terrible, and the current conflict in Gaza is especially dire. As part of their military strategy, Hamas uses civilians as human shields, both in combat and as shields for their terror infrastructure and rocket launchers.\n\nAs a result, despite the IDF's immense efforts, civilians continuously suffer. Reports from Gaza on casualty numbers, IDF airstrikes, and fighting between IDF soldiers and Hamas are constantly quoted by international media, but verifying these claims is challenging, and many have been proven entirely false.\n\nIn Gaza, there are no journalists who can expose the truth about these numbers and reports. True journalists working in Gaza cannot reveal that, for example, in an airstrike, civilians were not killed, only Hamas militants were.\n\nIf a Gaza journalist dares to tell the truth about the number of terrorists killed, Hamas will kill them immediately them.\nNone of the real journalists in Gaza can tell the truth.\n\nThe truth is one of the casualties of war, so it's crucial to expose the journey of lies and manipulation by the terror organization Hamas.\n\nVery few journalists in Gaza are genuine journalists, and even they can't tell the truth due to the dictatorial and terrorist rule in Gaza. The rest of the \"journalists\" in Gaza are not journalists but terrorists collaborating with Hamas.\n\nIt's time to understand that most journalists in Gaza are #TerroristsNotJournalists. And those who are real  journalists do not tell the truth.\n\nA \"press\" vest, anyone can buy at \"Ali Express\", but not everyone who wears a press vest is a journalist.\n#HamasislSIS #TerroristsNotJournalists"

On Saturday morning, Hamas monsters infiltrated their home, Adi took them both to a shelter where they tried to shoot the baby Eshel but Adi protected him. \"Mom told us to remember that she loves us the most in the world and then she left\" - said Negev.  For hours, no one knew where they were, the terrorists had time to film a propaganda video with the children and kidnapped them with the neighbor to Gaza, Negev raged and cried the whole way, he was injured and disturbed the terrorists, he kept yelling at the terrorist \"get me off\" and then, they decided to throw them on the road. The family was sure that their mother Adi had been kidnapped to Gaza, only a few days later the cruel truth became clear, the heroic lioness who fought for her children, Adi was murdered, she was found under a blanket, a closet and a bed in the shelter of the family's home, with her body wrapped in explosive charges.\n#October7massacre\n#HamasTerrorists"
