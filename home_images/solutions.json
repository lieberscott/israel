    "text": "The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (#UNRWA) was established by the UN, in 1949, to aid Palestinians displaced by the attack against the nascent state of Israel in 1948. Even though there already existed The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) this separate agency was created by the UN General Assembly.\n\nUNRWA has not solved, but rather exacerbated the refugee situation. Instead of resettling refugees, like the UNHCR, it perpetuates their claims and inflames their irredentist ideology. It‚Äôs schools, hospitals and various programs employ radical Islamist ideologues, propagandists and foot soldiers. It‚Äôs benefits fund terrorism and are a pillar of the festering sore that is the ‚Äúright of return‚Äù to all of Israel and the restoration of a mythical Palestine that never existed.\n\nAlthough UNRWA claims to aid over 5 million refugees, these people (and registered deceased and non-existent people) are not refugees by any definition. Refugee status is not maintained when people are resettled, let alone to offspring of those displaced.\n\nUNRWA was wrong in conception and disastrous in execution. It‚Äôs 1.5 billion annual budget (funded by the US, other countries, and NGOs) is sponsoring terrorism, totalitarianism, anti-Western hate and virulent antisemitism. Their facilities, personnel and budget are co-opted by criminals. The sometimes ignore, and often aid and participate in terrorism and crime. It‚Äôs time to end the farce that is UNRWA. It is long past time to #DefundUNRWA. https://t.co/ggn3oREPcI"
