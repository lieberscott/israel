    "text": "Let me be perfectly clear. The main cause of the Arab-Israeli conflict is Muslim antisemitism. Any Muslim/Arab who tells you otherwise is lying through their teeth. \n\nDon't fall for it. Don't fall for the facade that people like Queen Rania put on when they act like it's all about justice for the Palestinians, when they carefully pick their words, cherry-pick information and point the finger at others. When they pretend that they are the underdog and Israel is the oppressor. Don't be naive. For instance, below is a collection of shops named after Hitler across different parts of Egypt. So, no, I am n ot surprised the Jordanian named a shawarma shop \"October 7\".  \n\nFor goodness sake, believe me, before it is too late. You can't fix something that you refuse to admit is broken. I was born and grew up in Egypt. My entire family in Egypt are Muslim. I know what I am talking about."

    "text": "At this hour at this minute on this day in the year 2002 — Jan. 23, 2002 — a young man stepped out of a car to walk into a compound on the outskirts of Karachi, Pakistan, believing he was about to do an interview with a Muslim cleric. \n\nInstead, a man named Attaur Rehman grabbed him and pointed a gun at his head. \n\nPoor, innocent Danny Pearl, then just 38, asked sincerely: “Is this security?”\n\nSecurity, he thought for the sheikh. \n\nNo, dear Danny, this was an abduction in a scheme by this deluded militant, Omar Sheikh, just 28. \n\nIt was an operation in which you were a “target of opportunity,” but I will explain this to you tomorrow when I share how we discovered how you had been trapped.\n\nFor now, I will explain what you didn’t know — none of us knew — when you left my house on Zamzama Street hours earlier, a family of parrots squawking overhead.\n\nYou were on the hunt to find the man who was the local facilitator in Pakistan for Richard Reid, the “shoe bomber.” Farah Stockman, now at the New York Times, reported in the Boston Globe that it was this Sheikh Gilani. You were chasing the story, and Farah, to this day, regrets she got the story wrong. I regret it too. Those are the mistakes that happen. \n\nYou were trying to talk to Gilani directly. In this hour, your wife Mariane knew something was wrong. You didn’t answer your phone.\n\nYou always answered your phone. They took your phone. They chained you to a car engine. The guards later told the police you were confused. \n\nThey took your clothes. They brought you a 1970s warmup jacket and made you change into it. You were confused. \n\nOh poor dear Danny. We are in that compound with you, although the years have passed and you are not there anymore. We are with you, dear friend. Now and always. \n\nThis is the photo they sent of you. I want to ask the world: can you see Danny’s middle finger at his terrorists? That is the message that I received. \n\nFight the jerks, the militants, the extremists, the terrorists. \n\nShow them the middle finger. Defeat them with will power, intellect and heart.\n\nYou, Danny, could not do so in body, but I know you are with us, Danny, in spirit, so we can prevail to know the world you were always trying to both realize and celebrate.  \n\nTake Danny’s symbolic gesture with you, friends, real or imagined, to give yourself courage and determination. It has fueled me for the 21 years since, and we will use our courage to defeat the ideology and hate that seized this innocent man from the streets. For Danny.\n\nxoxo"

    "text": "“First We Cut the Throats of the Jews, Then the Gays and Finally the Christians”\n\n(An article fromTichys Einblick)\n\nGermany: Educators and social workers are discovering to their dismay that it is all but impossible to “integrate” young Muslim immigrants into German society.\n\nArk spokesman warns against radical young people\n\nTeachers and social workers are sounding the alarm: Arab young people are becoming more and more radical. Islamism has long since won in some migrant milieus.\n\n“Germany will soon be ours.” The sentence scares Wolfgang Büscher, and the man is hardly afraid of anything else.\n\nThe spokesman for the children’s and youth organization “Ark” says, “We are facing a catastrophe.” “Ark” looks after 7,000 children and young people from socially disadvantaged families every day in 33 facilities across the country. It is one of the largest aid organizations in the country.\n\nMore than 60% of the protégés have a so-called migration background. Muslim young people are radicalizing more and faster than ever before. “I have never experienced anything like this,” says Büscher. “Militant anti-Semitism” is sometimes a nice way of describing it. \n\n“First we cut the throats of the Jews, then the gays, and finally the Christians,” a young Arab recently told him. Büscher tried to counteract this with small gestures: \n\nHe pinned a small Israel flag on the lapel of his jacket. A 12-year-old saw this and then told the social worker: “I hate you. We’ll take the country back.”\n\n“Bild” newspaper shows that since the Hamas terrorist group massacred 1,200 Israelis, open hatred of Jews has become the norm in German schoolyards. “The integration went wrong. We hardly reach young people anymore,” says Herford teacher Birgit Ebel.\n\nShe reports that radical organizations — such as the Muslim Brotherhood or the extremist Turkish “Gray Wolves” — systematically try to recruit young people near schools and mosques.\n\nApparently with success: When Ebel observed a pro-Hamas rally and spotted some of her students in the demonstration, they shouted to their teacher: “Ms. Ebel, you Jewish whore.”\n\nBüscher says he sees little chance of reaching Muslim young people. “With the very young, conversations can still work. It no longer works for older teenagers. They reject our culture, our values,” he says.\n\nAnd the man for whom youth welfare was his life’s work then adds, visibly depressed: “The hatred is unimaginable.”\n\nAren’t these the guardians of “good and evil” who shouted that we have room? Or does the sentence apply again, as it did after the lost final victory in 1945… or the findings after the great pandemic?\n\nEvery thinking person could have predicted this development since 2015 at the latest. I assume that this Mr. Wolfgang Büscher and Ms. Birgit Ebel were at the forefront of defaming AfD politicians and their supporters as Nazis. \n\nIt is exactly this type of person who, with the best of intentions, does exactly the wrong thing because they DO NOT THINK further than their feelings. \n\nThey are probably only now starting to think about what they (the do-gooders) did wrong in their integration work and how they can change it for the better of society. \n\nRest assured, they have only made one mistake in that regard, and that is to believe that Muslims, who despise us and our culture, can be integrated into our way of life. Just as they will not be able to turn a wolf into a vegetarian, they will not be able to integrate Muslims into Western society. \n\nAlthough I’m pretty sure that their solution will be that Muslims don’t have to integrate with us; that’s not necessary, but that we need to integrate with THEM.\n\nI say NO, we will not bow to those who want to do us harm. The consequence for Muslims must be that they have to leave our countries, period. \n\nAfter all, you don’t let a fox spend the night in the chicken coop, even if there are 1,000 hens in there, now, do you?"
