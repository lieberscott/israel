They were happy people, it is said that they were like a ray of sunshine that shone on everyone around them. Each of them ended up in a relationship with a child and they became one warm and happy family. They went to the Nova music festival with some friends, they left the children with Antonio's parents. When the shooting started, she called her brother and told him in a frightened and terrified voice: \"They are shooting at us!, they are shooting at us! They are blowing us up\". The family then tried to call them several times but she did not answer anymore. In the shelter, grenades were thrown at them, they were seriously injured when a terrorist entered and shot all the wounded repeatedly. A survivor from the shelter said that Antonio was slowly dying for several hours. They had no chance. The two small children were waiting for them at home, Antonio's 7-year-old daughter Manuela and Yvonne's 4 and a half-year-old son Aviel. For many days they did not know what had become of them until the news arrived. The social workers and psychologists told the children that mom and dad had died. It's a sad story, about Yvonne and Antonio who loved to dance salsa, loved to be happy and entertain. But most of all they loved little Manuela and Aviel. It's a story about a family that Hamas monsters murdered in an instant, it's a story about small children crying. This is a story about Antonio and Yvonne - in life and in death they were inseparable."

She really loved her garden in the small apartment where she lived in Ofakim and every day until the last day she would go out to the garden and tend it. This is a story about yelizbeta who always took care of those around her, was very caring and loving. On October 7 at 06:40 she sent her daughter a message: \"Rita, there are a lot of alarms and booms and there is nothing on the news. It is dangerous for the neighbors who have to take small children out so early in the morning and stand in a stairwell during the alarms\". yelizbeta did on that terrible morning what she had done all her life - cared for others. She decided to go open the door and call the neighbors to come and hide from the missiles in the protected room of her house. But when yelizbeta opened the door, a ruthless Hamas monster murdered her with unimaginable brutality and left her bleeding to death in the doorway of her house. yelizbeta had no chance, she never reached the neighbors. This is a story about the 78-year-old yelizbeta, who was a complete world. She loved her family, had a big heart, was wise, modest and had a charming smile. This is a story about yelizbeta, who never hurt anyone, yelizbeta that in the terrifying moments of the morning of October 7th thought of others and most of all, she wanted to live."

Shani did not know that in those minutes thousands of armed terrorists infiltrated the festival area. Near road 232 there were mortar shells falling, Shani and her friends were directed to enter the shelter on the side of the road. They immediately did so, only they had no idea that in a few minutes, they would go through hell. When they went inside, terrorists arrived and started throwing grenades at them inside the shelter. Shani and her friends repelled the first grenades and when they already thought the nightmare was over, the terrorists sprayed them with gunfire. At a certain point the terrorists stopped the shooting and pulled out those who remained alive. The terrorists grabbed Shani and her roommate who came with her to the party and dragged them wounded and bleeding into the van. Shani came to the festival to celebrate the role she got in a new job she was accepted to. After long days of searching, uncertainty and endless worry, the family received the bitter news.  The terrorists murdered her and her roommate in a van on the way to Gaza with unimaginable cruelty. Imagine this, being held captive in a two meter shelter, surviving a grenade attack and close range shooting, being injured, kidnapped and then brutally murdered along the way. Imagine the last moments of Shani, who had a whole life ahead of her, and especially many dreams that she would never fulfill. Rest in peace Beautiful Girl, no one will hurt you anymore."

After leaving the course, Eden volunteered for the prestigious Sky Rider unit, which operates the UAVs that collect operational intelligence for combat units deep in enemy territory.\n\nEden served as a combat soldier and later as an officer. On October 7th, the female soldiers of the Nachal Oz military base awoke at 7am to the sounds of the base coming under attack. \n\nThe IDF spotters were almost all female, none were combat soldiers and were unarmed. Eden and four of her women, all combat soldiers, raced with them to the safe room with their handguns. Within a short time, the battle began inside of the base, right next to the safe room where the unarmed women huddled together.\n\nThe base's PA system called out \"Red Alert\" over and over, in reference to a rocket attack. Afterwards, the words \"Invasion, Invasion\" were heard instead.\n\nInside the safe room, Eden made eye contact with the armed soldiers, loaded her gun then cocked it. The soldiers followed her lead, a move that later changed the course of the battle.\n\nThe safe room had two entrances. Eden, who naturally assumed the role of battle leader in defending the room, took the left entrance and instructed the fighters to guard the right entrance.\n\nThe first terrorist attempted to come through the door on the right and was shot dead by the soldiers. It was clear that the terrorists would now try the other entrance. This would in turn create an opportunity to escape through the rear. Eden readied herself by the door and ambushed the terrorists as they entered, in order to hold them up and buy the others time to exit via the open door.\n\nWhen a group of terrorists charged with gunfire and grenades, they were met with suppressive fire from Eden and her handgun. These were golden seconds, precious moments that allowed six unarmed spotters and the four combat soldiers to escape unscathed to the barracks, where they stayed until an IDF force arrived to liberate them. \n\nEden fell in battle, and in so doing she saved the lives of ten other women serving as IDF soldiers.\n\nEden, your country salutes you."

They tried to escape with the vehicle and other friends, but a van with ten terrorists arrived in front of them and opened heavy fire on them. The vehicle overturned and they were trapped under it. The monsters didn't give up and came back to shoot them again and again, they had no chance, Ortal and Daniel were badly hit by the shooting. The terrorists started to approach them again, Daniel grabbed Ortal, his body became silent. He looked at her sister who was with them and said: \"That's it, it's over\". She answered him, \"Help me get Ortal out\", she held his hand and told him they had to get out of there and run and he answered her that he couldn't feel his legs. When she looked at his legs she realized that he had been shot several times and he would not be able to escape. The bodies of Daniel and Ortal were found hugging each other, they were buried side by side in the soil of the holy city where they grew up. Almost 5 months since that morning that their souls left for the stars, together, they dance quietly in heaven. They will shine above us forever."

He was at a party in Nova on the terrible Saturday, In all the published videos, they recorded a young man who tried to run away from the terrorists who tried to kidnap him, but it is important for us that people know that he was not just trying to run away, he was wounded by a shot in his right shoulder and right thigh, just before they put him in the van he saw in front of the his eyes how his best friend and girlfriend were being murdered. From the moment he was on the van, we saw in his eyes that he was not moved by the terrorists, did not pay them any mind, there was deep sorrow in his eyes for his friends, but a moment later his eyes were looking for the way out, his head was already thinking about how to get out of the van with all the wounded on it and the madness that was there. He got courage and jumped out of the van, tried to run away and if he hadn't been injured he would have fought back! It is important to us that everyone who sees this video will understand how brave he was! We are proud of him for his choice and the courage and daring he had, which God gave him in those moments! From the first moment we realized he was missing, we waited a week for a miracle and we knew from our acquaintance with his courage that kidnapping was not an option for him, it was clear to us that for him it was out of the question.

They tried to take the weapon from him, because they thought it might be their only chance to be saved from there, and to save those hiding inside - in this act, they prevented the terrorist from entering the shelter and Limor and Alina were saved. Then it gets quiet. Alina and Limor realized that Seffi and Gal had been murdered and the terrorists who encountered them at the entrance drove away because they were sure there was no one else inside, but unfortunately another terrorist came there, threw a grenade in and shot them at short range - Limor was murdered and Alina was seriously injured and lost consciousness. A few hours later soldiers arrived who discovered her and evacuated her to the hospital and she was saved. It's a story about Seffi and Gal who came to Nova to dance and found themselves in a battle for life. A story about a moment's decision to do everything possible. It is a story about heroism and courage of the two best friends who decided to protect others with their bare hands and were murdered together. Their smile there in Nova will be remembered forever. Their spirit will never be forgotten."

This young man who was full of goodness loved life, his family and his friends more than anything. Ben came to the Nova festival to dance and have fun with his friend Itai. They realized that the situation was bad and thousands of terrorists were massacring hundreds of young people. They could run away and save themselves. They had everything they needed to get away from there and most likely they would have succeeded. But they didn't run away. They saw someone with a gunshot wound and without thinking twice - they helped her and treated her. These are the kind of heroes you only see in movies. They saw an ambulance that was damaged, broke its window and took the first aid kit from inside. They helped every injured person they saw and removed bodies from the area. For one moment they didn't think about themselves, they only thought about how to save as many people as possible. With their bare hands they pressed the wounds of others and made tourniquets. Both were murdered with unimaginable cruelty and were shot several times. It was too late for them. They say that Ben was unusually smart. They say that he was always helping, always thinking of others. They say that he had a captivating personality and that his smile was  An integral part of him, that he was full of goodness. And they are right, he was just like that. This is a story about angels who stayed to save others. This is the last picture of Ben, dodging terrorists' bullets, with a first aid kit on his back, with one goal, to save people in Nova."

He managed to get to his car, picked up 4 people he didn't know on the way and set off. When he reached a nearby town, he dropped them off at a safe place and called his brother who begged him to come home, but he refused. Instead of running away, he took an unusual and brave decision and turned back to the festival grounds. He entered a fire ground, a place where thousands of terrorists are slaughtering hundreds of people, and there he gathered 8 more people he didn't know, brought them to a safe place and again.. came back. On the way he called his girlfriend who begged him to come home, but Ben wanted to reach his friends, he knew they must have already been injured, he wanted to save them. On the way he picked up 3 more people, but this time, the terrorists caught him and brutally murdered him. His vehicle was found with hundreds of bullet holes. This is a story about Ben, an unusual person. It's a story about courage, about a guy who came to enjoy and dance at a party and in one moment found himself in a fight for life. It's a story about Ben, who didn't think about himself, and wanted to save others. He could have escaped, but returned to hell for others and paid for it with his life."

He contacted his girlfriend on the morning of Saturday October 7th, the terrorists had already massacred dozens of defenseless young people. He stammered and was shocked. She begged him to run away and he replied: \"No!\" Then he said he was holding the neck of someone who had been shot in the throat. He traveled with 4 other friends to Nova, three were murdered in front of his eyes, he chose to stay, he chose to save lives, and he did so until his last moments. Among his belongings is a document he wrote a year ago while he was in a personal empowerment workshop in a village in Turkey. And in the vision he wrote: \"With the empowerment and determination in me, quietly and with inner ease I build a world founded on values ‚Äã‚Äãof abundance, prosperity, free love and freedom. In my world, every child believes in himself, and accepts my whole world full of warmth and love. In my life experience, and the fire that burns in me, I inspire and motivate to dare and dream. I make every person believe that there is an inner bird in me that wants to fly and break out towards the dreams. With generosity, generosity and care, I open my heart, my home, and my soul, to every person who will have an abundance of giving. So that he knows that there is always Good people around him. I'm a success story, I'm proud of myself and the path I've taken, despite everything\". This is a story about the brave Moshe. Moshe with the vision, with the big heart. You will be an inspiration to us all. Rest in peace hero."

This is a story about Adam whose life was not easy, this is the sad story of a man who fled from Janjaweed, armed militias that take a central part in the atrocities of the Darfur region. He arrived in Libya in 2006, and after his father and uncles were murdered, he continued from Libya to Egypt and then arrived in Israel. His path was a path full of pain, loneliness and sorrow. He lived in Israel for about a decade. On October 7th he heard continuous shooting under his house in Sderot and then he heard screams, he decided to go out to give aid to those who need it and try to save lives. The Hamas terrorists who captured him brutally murdered him. Adam who escaped from rape and murder, was murdered by merciless terrorists in Israel, which gave him refuge. His body was only identified thanks to his toothbrush after five days. His death was kept a secret for about a month, the authorities wanted to get the hard news first to his mother who still lives in Darfur. He used to volunteer, they say he always helped everyone and his heart was clean. Adam Rima fled his whole life and was murdered in the only place he felt safe. Now, in heaven, he will rest in peace."

Everyone who worked with him says he was one of the best security managers. It was said about him that he was eloquent, stately, always radiated calmness, and never missed a detail or a small flaw. Aviv always made sure everything was in order and he worked according to rules. The same thing happened on October 7. When the first rocket was in the air, Aviv ran towards the main stage and announced to all the revelers to leave safely. In order to speed up the evacuation of the area, Aviv and his team decided to approach the entrance to the festival and directed revelers on their way. A few minutes later, several revelers returned to the scene and said that terrorists had shot at them. Aviv and his team made a brilliant and unusual decision to block the access route to the party by placing vehicles from the north and south, and to open a new escape route through the area so that revelers would encounter as few terrorists as possible who had already surrounded the entire complex. Aviv and his team were the escapees' protective wall. Aviv's team fought like heroes with their bare hands against the terrorists and allowed others to escape. After minutes of fighting, a terrorist fired an RPG missile at the checkpoint and a terrorist van carrying a submachine gun broke through the mobility and sprayed everyone on the road - Aviv was killed. It's a story about Aviv who protected the thousands of Nova members who just wanted to dance quietly. This is an amazing story about Aviv and the festival staff who prevented a bigger disaster with their bodies. This is a story about Aviv who chose to fight and not run away.  This is a story about Aviv who was a hero in his life and in his death."

On Saturday morning, little Koren was awake in the living room, at 6:29 a rocket barrage began. Gil caught the children, all still wearing underwear on the way to the street shelter. The terrorists were already on the neighbor's balcony. But the children screamed and cried and then the terrorists noticed them and started walking towards them. As soon as they arrived at the entrance of the shelter the terrorists threw a grenade at them, Gil who saw the grenade and wanted with all his heart to save his little children, lay on the grenade and was killed on the spot. Even though Gil absorbed all the impact, the little ones Shay and Koren absorbed shrapnel. Shay bled from the eye and they went crying, bleeding and screaming to the trailer. The terrorists looted Gil's body and marched after them. The next picture is as if taken from a horror movie, little Shay and Koren are sitting in front of monsters who are indifferent to their dire situation. Two small children who have just seen their father murdered in front of their eyes, Little Shay, only 8 years old, lost his eye, they are bleeding, crying and screaming and the terrorists drag them and beat them, Then the monsters stop and go get drinks from the fridge. When the monsters finished drinking, they decided to go on a tour of the house where the children's mother, Sabin, was staying. The terrorists left the little children in the trailer and left, they circled the house to try to find a way to get into it and were unsuccessful. At 7:28 a.m. the neighbor Yigal Wex went outside to try to understand what all the explosions were. The terrorists saw him, left the house and went in his direction to murder him. They shot him and then went back to throw a grenade at the house of Sabin and Zohar - the older son. The electricity went out and the terrorists decided to continue slaughtering others. At exactly the same time, Gil and Sabin's eldest son Or was found at Zikim beach, spending time camping with friends. Terrorists who infiltrate the beach also kill him and his two friends with unimaginable cruelty. It's a story about Gil, A father who protected his little children, lay down on a grenade for them. It's a story about Or, only 16 years old who went fishing and was mercilessly murdered. After little Shay left the hospital, he said: \"It was very difficult. A boy my age shouldn't blow up like that\". It's an incredible story about the Taasa family, A family that is no longer complete, a family with a bleeding heart."

On Saturday morning, alarms started, they folded the tents and set off, home. \"We love you, don't worry, we'll get home and everything will be fine\". But they never came home. Monsters were waiting for them on the highway, not far from Sderot they opened heavy fire at them. The frightened family stopped on the side of the road, and tried to indicate that they had little children with them. The terrorists pulled out Dina and Yevgeni sprayed them with hundreds of bullets and then pulled out the crying Alin and Eitan and executed them. Imagine, parents who just wanted to protect their little children from hundreds of bullets chasing them. Imagine Alin and Eitan who saw their parents murdered, waiting for their turn. For days no one knew what happened to them, first Dina the mother was found, Yevgeni the father was found after her, then their little son Eitan. Alin was last found. This is a story about Alin, who loved to make plasticine figures and play with dolls, this is a story about Eitan, who was a sweet child with special needs and was very happy for his fifth birthday. And Yevgeni and Dina, good and loving parents, who were and are no longer. It's a story about a family. The kapshiter family that went camping together, and never came back."

Because in a reasonable world, peace-seeking people don't get up on Saturday morning to look for their children in the middle of a massacre. It happened on October 7 in Israel. This is the story of 3 guys who have been together everywhere since they were 8 years old. This is the story of Gal, Nadav and Ofek. A year after returning from the trip to South America, they went to the Nova Music Festival. At 7 in the morning, Nadav sent his father a message: \"Dad, they are shooting at us. We got out of the car, we are hiding in the bushes. There are many people hiding here, I can't speak\". Ofek wrote to his mother: \"Mom, I can't talk, they are shooting at us from every direction, we are hiding, they stole my car\". Immediately afterwards he sends her his location and writes: \"Know that I love you, if I don't survive this\".  Gal's mother and Nadav's father do not wait and go to the scene. They manage to pass all the roadblocks set up along the way and they reach the slaughter area. They were imbued with a purpose, they would bring the children home. On the way, terrorists shoot at them and they continue, to Nova. Among the bodies of young people and burnt vehicles they search for them. It took hours, but they reached the bushes where the boys were hiding. And then it happens, they found them. Nadav and Ofek are hugging as if they were protecting each other, and Gal is not far away. They took 3 body bags from an ambulance that passed by, put the three children inside, and put them in their car. Imagine this, parents, finding the injured bodies of their children, putting them in a body bag, putting them in the car, and driving home with them. Gal Nadav and Ofek were the first victims brought to burial on October 7. This is an incredible story about a family. It's a story about parents who did everything, about a deep friendship that was murdered. About 3 children who went to a party, ran away, hid and were slaughtered with unimaginable cruelty, feeling every second. This is a story about Gal, Ofek and Nadav, who only spread good in the world, and now they spread it in heaven, together forever."

A few months before the party, Moshe took her to the bank of the stream and proposed to her there. They were inseparable. Yuval went with her mother and chose a wedding dress, and they arranged to get married after she finished her studies - in February. On October 7, they spent time at the Nova music festival under the sky, as she liked. Yuval and Moshe arrived at the party early in the morning, an hour before the massacre. When the terrorists infiltrated the festival they tried to escape and reached an intersection, where they thought they met police officers directing the traffic and they realized they were in a safe place. But then, the police opened fire on them and it turned out that they were terrorists. The car that was behind them had time to turn around and escape, but for Yuval and Moshe it was too late. The terrorists fired hundreds of bullets at them and left them no chance. It took 3 days to identify them and inform their family that they would never return. It's a story about the wedding dress that was left hanging in the closet. This is a story about Yuval and Moshe who were murdered together, found together and buried together. On their tombstone it is written: \"In their life and in their death they were not separated\"."

In the last WhatsApp message she sent them, she wrote: \"Dad, promise me that everything is fine with you. They are shooting at us in the house, Naor and I are hiding under the bed\". Naor wrote to his family: \"They are shooting at our house\" and then he disappeared, And since then the connection with them was lost. They went through hours of fear, shooting and explosions. Their neighbors were kidnapped, slaughtered, one after the other. They hear everything under the bed in Kibbutz Kfar aza, hear and cry in silence. Then the monsters entered their house, and hunted them with unimaginable cruelty. Hundreds of bullet holes in every room, in the kitchen, in the washing machine.

I just want to get out of here\" and when she and Lidor managed to reach the shelter in the Re'im Junction in their car, they thought they had been saved - they had no idea what was waiting for them there. The terrorists started throwing grenades into the shelter, the first grenade went over Lidor's head and he started running and was shot to death with hundreds of bullets. Hamas' Go Pro camera recorded the moment he ran from the shelter until his murder. The person hiding in the shelter threw the grenades out, Nitzan's uncle and his friend who were with her jumped on two grenades to protect others, but at one point the terrorists threw so many grenades inside and they exploded on everyone. Nitzan was considered missing for 6 days - Lidor was already brought for burial. One day, Nitzan's phone broadcast the location and the family realized that he was broadcasting the way to the pathology institute - where only bodies led. There it turned out - Nitzan was murdered by an explosion of grenades that were thrown at her while she was hiding inside the shelter. It's a story about Nitzan and Lidor, the lovers who came to celebrate together, Nitzan and Lidor who lost their lives in the most cruel way that could be in front of each other.

    "text": "‚ö†Ô∏è TRIGGER WARNING‚ö†Ô∏è\n\nI'm nauseous even posting this. More horrific details from the Association of Rape Crisis Centers report about Hamas's sexual crimes on October 7th continue to emerge. According to the @MailOnline\n\n'The genitals of both women and men were brutally mutilated, and sometimes weapons were inserted into them. The terrorists did not stop at shooting, they also cut and mutilated sexual organs and other body parts with knives.'\n\nThe testimonies included claims Hamas gunmen repeatedly stabbed an injured woman while they raped her; that victims had nails, grenades and knives inserted into their sexual organs; and how survivors fleeing the festival witnessed 'girls whose pelvises were simply broken from being raped so much'.\n\nThe authors noted that rape was 'often' perpetrated in front of an audience, including partners, families or friends, in order to 'increase the pain and humiliation of all present'.\n\nOne survivor of the Nova festival said the aftermath was an 'apocalypse of bodies, girls without clothes, some missing their upper, some their lower parts'.\n\nThe report made reference to the story of a woman at the festival whose breast was cut off with a box cutter before her assailants threw it on the floor 'and passed it between them like a toy'.\n\nAnother described fleeing the site and seeing a woman lying on her stomach near the road without pants or underwear, her legs apart. Her genitalia was described as looking 'as if someone tore her apart'.\n\nAnother survivor said they saw women tied to trees, mutilated with 'all their organs cut, damaged' and 'iron rods inserted into their sexual organs'.\n\nYoni Saadon, a survivor who witnessed the rape of a young woman enduring severe violence, recounted a victim crying out: 'Stop it - already I'm going to die anyway from what you are doing, just kill me!'\n\nThe witness said 'when they finished they were laughing and the last one shot her in the head'.\n\nOne witness said she saw a young woman with a back injury, her trousers pulled down below her knees, being raped by one terrorist as another 'pulled from her hair'.\n\n'Each time the woman resisted, the terrorist stabbed her in the back.'\n\nIn another case, she said she saw how while one terrorist was raping a woman, another cut into her and mutilated her body. \n\nRaz Cohen and Shoham Gueta, survivors who hid from Hamas at the festival, said they saw terrorists raping a young woman as they stabbed her repeatedly, 'literally butchering her'. \n\nMultiple witnesses reported seeing men who had been shot in the genitalia, or had sexual organs 'cut off'.\n\nA paramedic attending the scene said: 'There were a lot of gun wounds there. Shooting was targeted at sexual organs. We saw that a lot. They had a thing with sexual organs'.\n\nARCCI also reported how family members, partners and friends in raided homes were forced to watch sexual abuse before their murders.\n\nThe positions bodies were found in indicated some had been made to watch the abuse and murder of their partners, the report suggested.\n\nThe authors said there was a 'pattern' that 'emerged clearly' in testimonies.\n\nIn one case, a mother's body was found by search and rescue teams, her hands tied behind her back with signs of struggle.\n\nThe body of her daughter, a girl or young woman, was found in the next room with her pants and underwear rolled down.\n\nAn IDF paramedic recovered the bodies of two girls from another building, one found sexually abused with a knife in her genitals. They said one of the girls was found with the remains of semen on her back."

People have been shot in the head while begging on their knees for mercy. People melted into each other because of RPG. People were reduced to ashes because they hid under a car that was set on fire. Entire families were burned alive. Small children were beheaded. Women's private parts were cut off and thrown on the road. Women were raped until their last breath. Hundreds of people were kidnapped. 111 days and every day since is the same day - October 7th."
