    "text": "Sam Harris on pro-Hamas demonstrators in the US: “Our streets have been filled with people literally tripping over themselves in their eagerness to demonstrate that they cannot distinguish between those who intentionally kill babies and those who inadvertently kill them... If you’re  waving the flag of people who murder non-combatants intentionally, killing parents in front of their children and children in front of their parents, burning people alive at a music festival devoted to peace, and decapitating others and dragging their dismembered bodies through the streets — all to shouts of ‘God is Great’...  If you have landed, proudly and sanctimoniously on the wrong side of this asymmetry, this vast gulf between savagery and civilization, while marching through the quad of an Ivy League university... I’m not sure it matters that your moral confusion is due to the fact that you just happen to hate Jews — whether you’re an antisemite or just an apologist for atrocity is probably immaterial. The crucial point is that you are dangerously confused about the moral norms and political sympathies that make life in this world worth living.\" \n\nhttps://t.co/pAOrvxr4Df",
